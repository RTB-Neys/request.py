PASSWORD GENERATOR

Description: Create a password after the user is prompted to define criteria. 

When the user clicks the button "Generate Password" they are first promoted for password length. If they select a range outside of 8-128, the user will be advised to select a number within range. 

The program will prompt a selection of numbers, characters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. If the user selects none to all criteria, they will be advised to select at least each one.
